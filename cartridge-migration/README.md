# Cartridge Migration


This is a first idea of migration work.

After upgrade node and broker packages use migration.sh script on node.

    $ migration.sh -a <app-uuid> -n <app-namespace> -m <app-name> -c <cartridge-type>
    
    

#Caution!!

This script is under development data loss and application crash might be experienced.
